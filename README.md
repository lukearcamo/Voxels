# Voxels

This is a *personal WIP* project in which I try to recreate Minecraft. The purpose of this project is *not* to make a game, but rather for me to understand Minecraft's inner workings.

Unfortunately, I started tracking this project with Git/Github way after I already began, so the early part of its history is not available.

This whole project was built on Windows, so it may not work on other platforms, but I havent tested that (maybe if you compile it on your platform it may work?).
Additionally, the .vscode json files contain personalized stuff, so they may not work on your system. They are just here for my archival purposes.

## Resources/Credits

Earth sky texture was extracted from a Minecraft resource pack called [Dramatic Skys](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/dramatic-skys).

Sunset sky texture was screenshotted from the [Three.js sky shader](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_shaders_sky.html), although this was back when it used the Uncharted 2 tonemapping; now it looks too pale for my tastes.

_Note: I intend to replace the sky textures later on, perhaps to something more pixellated to match the voxel theme._

Font image textures were created by me on Google Slides (bizarre choice I know) and then screenshotted, because I didn't have a vector image editor at the time. I don't own the fonts themselves, of course; Consolas belongs to Microsoft, and Ubuntu Mono is under the Ubuntu Font License.

_Note: I plan on making my own font later, perhaps also in a pixellated style, kinda like Minecraft's font but a bit higher resolution._

[Igsi](https://github.com/lukearcamo/Igsi), an OpenGL library by me. It credits a few other sources, like Three.js, for some of its code.
